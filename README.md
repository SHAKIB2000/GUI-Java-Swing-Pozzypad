# Pozzypad

A desktop application for writting and drawing

Modern Technology brought the use of pictures in various fields. Also a simple picture speaks thousand words. So applications are required to create images and save them. An attempt has been made to do the same using simple algorithms. 

The objective of the project is to create an application that can draw simple images. As Java is an object oriented based language, Java language has been choosen for the purpose. The Pozzypad using ‘Swing Java’ application is created to easily draw images using several tool options. They include options like drawing circles, lines, rectangles and solid fill areas in 2D. However, complex 3D images are not considered for the project. 

The images created using this application can be saved. We can further retrieve the images and view them. However, the options for editing of images like cropping are not provided. We are able to save the images into raw file format. So the images can be viewed only in this application. 

This application is compatible with Windows Operating System and Java compiler.
